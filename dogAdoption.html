            What Questions Should You Ask A Dog Breeder?
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            You have decided that it’s time to add a pet to your family. After some consideration, you’ve fallen in love
            with a particular dog breed. Many people then look for a dog breeder to make their purebred-pup dream come
            true. Like any responsible future pet parent, you still have some questions before you take the plunge and
            choose your new dog, which may be why you’re here!
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Did you know that there are LOTS of purebred dogs waiting for the perfect forever home at shelters and
            rescue groups? Not only that, but there are also special breed-rescue groups who dedicate their efforts to
            finding homes for just one breed of dog.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Dogs of every type and breed can end up in shelters. Before you start checking for a breeder to find your
            next family pet, let’s take a step back and look at some things to consider when starting the search for a
            special pup.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            How to find a dog breed near you:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            You’ve researched which breeds you’re interested in, and now it’s time to get searching!
            Begin your search for a dog (or search for a cat) by adding your location, how far you’d be willing to
            travel, and which breed you’re looking for. If you want to narrow it down after your initial search, you
            will see options to filter it by gender, age, size, and some personality traits (good with other dogs, kids,
            etc.).
            Once you’ve plugged in your search requirements, your results will automatically sort themselves to show the
            dogs that are closest to you first. You can click on each individual dog for more information and to see
            which rescue group or shelter is caring for that pet.
            Don’t fret about any perceived lack of options. 25-30% of dogs in search of forever homes in shelters are
            purebred dogs, so you are bound to find a new best friend.
            Being flexible in your search can ultimately lead you to your most perfect fit. While you may have a
            particular breed in mind, if you’re open to looking at other dogs whose personality and traits match your
            family, you could end up pleasantly surprised. There are lots of different types of dogs who would love an
            active lifestyle and would enjoy being your hiking partner, just as there are plenty who’d prefer to be a
            lap dog and snuggle up next to you on the couch. Fit is key in everyone’s happiness, so keep an open mind
            and enjoy the adventure of choosing a new pet.

            How to find a puppy near you:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            If you’re specifically looking for a puppy, you want to start by searching for a dog, and then narrow your
            search by age.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            When deciding on which age range would be best, think about these things:
        <ul>
            <li> are a lot of fun but are also lots of work. Do you have the time to train a puppy from scratch,
                including housebreaking?</li>
            <li>Does the energy level of a puppy suit your current lifestyle?</li>
            <li>Do you have the time to socialize your puppy? Pups need lots of structured exposure to new things in
                their first months of life.</li>
            <li>Is size important to you? A puppy’s full-grown size is sometimes hard to estimate.</li>
            <li>Are you prepared for any quirky personality traits or behavior challenges that may arise as your puppy
                grows up?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            How to find a young or adult dog to suit your home:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            When adopting an adult dog, you can specifically look for one whose story matches your needs, such as being
            friendly with other dogs, being good with children, and other past history that the rescue or shelter may
            already have. Having more history on a dog will mean fewer surprises for you as an adopter.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">

            the breed, or just want to have some fun, try taking our dog selector quiz.

            You are in search of a new family member and best friend. The dogs on Petfinder are in search of a forever
