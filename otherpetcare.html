            5 Tips for Saving Money on Rabbit Care
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Mary Lempert is the founder and manager of The Rabbit Advocate, where this blog post originally appeared.
            She has served as a rabbit behavior and rehabilitation consultant for the House Rabbit Society, House Rabbit
            Network and the MSPCA in Massachusetts and, most recently, for the Almost Home Humane Society in Lafayette,
            IN. She lives in West Lafayette, IN, with her rabbits Graysie and Willoughby and any number of foster
            bunnies.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Most rabbit-parents know that rabbits are not cheap pets — their medical care as exotic animals can add up,
            and they seem to love chewing on your most expensive items (clothes, furniture, equipment, etc.). However,
            there are several easy ways to reduce the costs of their daily care and manage your rabbit expenses more
            effectively. Here are just a few:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Hay: Buy in bulk from the farm
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Buying small bags of hay from pet stores can get expensive fast! Buying hay directly from a farmer can cut
            costs way down. Ordering hay in 50-lb. boxes online from farms is already a bargain compared to the small
            bags from pet stores, but taking a trip to a local farmer to buy a bale is really the way to go. A bale of
            Timothy hay, which can last several months, typically costs about $10.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Vegetables: Ask your grocery store for veggie scraps
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Ask staffers at your local grocery store to collect their vegetable scraps for you. Grocery stores throw
            away tons of perfectly good veggies, including carrot, beet, and radish tops, or the outer layers of
            lettuces, cabbages, and other greens. Farmers’ markets are also a fantastic source for free vegetables. Be
            sure to never use vegetables that look wilted or old and wash everything extra carefully. Another idea is to
            try growing your own mint (which grows like a weed), parsley or other herbs in your garden. Be sure to check
            which plants are toxic to rabbits before feeding anything new. For a preliminary list, read A Rabbit’s Basic
            Needs.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Litter: Check the cat aisle
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            A little insider knowledge here can save you some big bucks! If you use Yesterday’s News or some other
            litter brand that is also marketed for cats, buy the bags in the cat-litter section, as they tend to be much
            cheaper per pound than the bags sold in the small-animal section. Avoid clay and pine-based litters, since
            both have been associated with serious health risks to rabbits
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            The litter box: Get creative
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            A litter box is really just a plastic box, so why pay extra for a fancy cat litter pan from a pet store when
            you can grab a shallow plastic box from Walmart for half the price?
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Toys: Try DIY
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            There are a lot of expensive bunny toys available, but it seems more often than not, rabbits just love
            playing with old-fashioned toys that don’t cost a cent, such as cardboard boxes, toilet-paper rolls stuffed
            with hay, and homemade cardboard tunnels or castles. Baby toys (such as plastic keys on a ring) can be
            cheaper than similar products sold in pet stores. Just make sure the plastic is hard, and not the “teething”
            kind, which can be chewed and ingested by rabbits.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            And one thing not to skimp on: Pellets
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            There’s a wide variety of pellets available, with a wide variety of price tags. You don’t need to go for the
            most expensive bag out there, but you do need to make sure the first ingredient is Timothy hay as opposed to
            alfalfa. Alfalfa hay can be good for rabbits up to a year old, but has too much calcium and fat for adult
            rabbits

            Bird Poison Prevention Tips
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            If you share your home with a companion avian, you know how sensitive your feathered friend is to his
            environment. Birds, for example, are more adversely affected by smoke and gases than dogs, cats and other
            mammals, and special considerations must be taken to keep them in the “sing” of things. In honor of Adopt A
            Rescued Bird Month, we asked Dr. Jill A. Richardson of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) for
            some smart tips to keep your home safe and secure for your pet:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            “Birds are highly sensitive to inhalant fumes,” explains Richardson. Please avoid exposing yours to fumes
            from overheated Teflon- or Silverstone-coated pans, automobile exhaust, tobacco smoke, glues and paints,
            insecticidal fumigants, perfume and hair spray.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Most pesticide baits contain ingredients, such as grains and sugars, that can attract your bird. Should you
            need to use rat and mouse bait or ant and roach traps, take care to place them in areas that are
            inaccessible to your pet.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Keep all prescription and over-the-counter drugs out of your bird’s reach, preferably in closed cabinets.
            Says Richardson, “Pain killers, cold medicines, anti-cancer drugs, vitamins and diet pills are all examples
            of human medications that can be lethal to birds, even in small doses.”
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Never allow your bird access to areas in which cleaning agents are being used or stored. Should your pet
            ingest them, he could suffer from a range of symptoms, depending on the substance, from mild stomach upset
            to severe burns of the tongue, mouth and crop.
        </p>

            Polly may want a cracker, but she certainly shouldn’t have the following foods that are potentially harmful

            Household Items Dangerous to Pet Birds
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Puddytats aren’t the only source of danger for pet birds. Even a window can prove dangerous to a bird if
            he’s let out of his cage unsupervised. Adopters of birds need to watch their newfound friends like hawks;
            supervised playtime will keep the birds from getting hurt. Here’s a list to help prep your adopters for a
            few trouble spots; once folks realize that the most common things can be dangerous to their new pets,
            they’ll learn to think more creatively when looking for other potential hazards.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Your hobbies:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            You may be a master craftsperson, but some of the glues used in craft projects produce fumes that are bad
            for birds. Be careful of model glue, too—your child’s “Build a B-52 Bomber” project may do serious damage to
            your bird’s health.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            The paint on your walls:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            If your house is an older model, the paint on the walls may contain lead. Be aware of where your bird’s cage
            is; if he’s too close to a wall, he may lean out and try to treat himself to a nibble of paint flakes.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            Your laptop, your VCR, your Tiffany lamp:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Unless your bird is addicted to eBay or the Home Shopping Network, it’s not so much these objects themselves
            that pose the danger, but the electric cords that power ’em. Consider investing in a cord safety device. A
            plastic hose that encloses the cords can shield your bird from the shocking repercussions of her prying
            beak.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            The overhead fan:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Moving objects overhead make birds nervous anyway, but the overhead fan is like a giant, slicing turbine to
            a roaming pet bird. Keep the fan off when your bird is out on a jaunt.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-heading">
            That stylin’ antique birdcage:
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Some older birdcages have lead components; beware the seed-guard mesh in these decorative old attic
            behemoths—the lead in some of them can kill your bird. Your grandmother’s birdcage may complement your
            Victorian decor, but the dead bird won’t. Neither will the lingering bad karma.
