            While a recent study conducted by the ASPCA found that 35% of US households have a cat and a 44% have a
            dog, the decision to get a pet takes a lot of consideration. You will need to consider what kind of animal
            will best fit your lifestyle. Making a choice based on you level of commitment should give you a good idea
            of what type of pet will best fit into your lifestyle and priorities. Although there is not one perfect pet
            for everyone, there are many reasons why you should have a pet.
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Pets like dogs and cats offer their owners with companionship, understanding and an unbreakable bond of
            devotion that they can’t find elsewhere. Other pets like birds, fish and reptiles provide owners with
            structure and purpose to daily life through having a pet-care routine. The daily routine of caring for your
            pet is very satisfying for pet owners who feel like they may be lacking purpose. The benefits owning a pet
            are considerable. Read on for the 7 top reasons why you should have a pet.

            They Will Make You Laugh Every Single Day
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Laughter has been show to reduce stress, improve your mood, strengthen your resilience, and a good belly
            laugh can even burn calories! Daily laughter should not be underestimated as a reason to get a pet. Cat
            owners roll in laughter watching their cat chase a laser light or feather toy. Dog owners can’t help but
            giggle at their pets as they jump for joy or chase their own tails. Time spent with your pet is sure to
            provide happy, funny moments, day after day.

            Pets Teach You Selflessness
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Author Donald L. Hicks said “those who teach about humanity aren’t always humans“. Pets often teach their
            owners about selflessness in a more profound way than another person could. When pet owners have a strong
            bond with their pets, they will do anything to help them when they are hungry or in need of medical
            attention. As humans, we understand that the very survival of our pets is in our hands. Owning a pet teaches
            us the value of selflessness.

            A Pet Can Help Make New Friends
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Instead of retreating to your comfort zone, owning a pet will introduce you to new social situations like
            shared activities of other pet owners. Pets actually work as an amazing ice breaker during everyday
            activities with your pet like taking you dog for a walk, a trip to the dog park or participating in
            pet-centered events. Meeting other pet owners who have similar interests in person or through online forums
            will give pet owners who may be shy, or new in town a way to socialize and make new friends.

            Pets Make the Best Companions
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            As we age or our relationship status changes, loneliness can lead to depression or other resulting emotional
            issues. Pets will always be there for you and stick with you no matter what. A pet can give you excellent
            support and unmatched companionship through their natural sense of empathy with no judgment in return. In
            fact, many pet owners prefer the companionship of their pet to that of other people. You will always be able
            to count on your loyal little buddy to be there when you need to vent, cry or just want to forget about
            things for a while.

        <p class="wa-heading">
            A Pet Can Help You Get in Shape, and Stay in Shape
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Owning a pet will improve your physical, mental and emotional health. Beyond the physical activity, mental
            comfort and consistent emotional support, owning a pet will actually extend your life. The American Heart
            Association reports that the physical exercise you get with playtime and walking your dog attributes to the

            A Pet Helps Relieve Stress
        </p>
        <p class="wa-para">
            Pet owners will attest that simply being together with their pet greatly reduces stress, depression and
            anxiety. Studies have proven an increase in the stress-reducing hormones dopamine and oxytocin and a
            decrease in the levels of the stress-causing hormone call cortisol for pet owners. Findings from an
            interesting study, released in Science magazine, revealed that when a pet owner looked into the eyes of
            their pet, oxytocin levels increased in both the pet owner and their pet. Companionship, regular physical
            fitness and just maybe those adorable puppy dog eyes will help your mental state and better help you to cope
            with everyday life’s challenges.
